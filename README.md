# odin-recipes

So far in the Odin Project, I've learned the basics of the command line, how to manage a project using git, and how to create a very simple website in HTML.

## Goals for this project

- create a recipe website in HTML
- use the command line as much as possible 
- use links, images, and headers appropriately
- leave behind a healthy, clear and concise changelog in git
