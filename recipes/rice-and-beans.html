    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Now this is a dish that I can honestly say I've loved all my life. Actually, it would be more honest to say that I can't remember a time in my life when I <em>didn't</em> love a simple bowl of rice and beans, cuban style.</p>
    <p>It must be a result of growing up in on the Atlantic coast of south Florida, because even though the way the Puerto Ricans make rice and beans is in my genes, the way the Cubans do it is in my heart.</p>
    <p>Cook the beans in sofrito, sazon goya and bacon fat, let it simmer until all the spices and flavors have mixed, and the moment you life the lid and the rushing steam heats your cheeks, you'll know that you'll never go back.</p>
